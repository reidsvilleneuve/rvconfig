This: 1) converts the leftmost backspace button (left of the pinky) to capslock
per normal QWERTY keyboards, and 2) causes the lower-innermost buttons to
activate layer 2 when held. It is intended to be used with esc and caps lock
swapped. This setup keeps usage similar when the external keyboard isn't
connected.
